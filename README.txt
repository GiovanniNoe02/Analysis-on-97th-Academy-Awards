Operational Guide – Data Management Project  
By Chiara Genuardi and Giovanni Noè  
University of Milan Bicocca – Data Management Course

This guide outlines the steps to ensure reproducibility of the Data Management Project carried out by Chiara Genuardi and Giovanni Noè for the Data Management course at the University of Milan Bicocca.

Please note that this project was specifically designed to be executed between March and April 2025, as it captures the state of movie ratings and public reception before and immediately after the Academy Awards Ceremony held on March 2, 2025. While the code can technically be executed at any time, some adjustments may be necessary.

The following files are included in the same folder as this README and are required to reproduce or inspect the project:

- data_management.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the dataset creation process  
- reddit_comments.pkl - Pickle file containing a list of Reddit comments related to the Oscars  
- data_management.db - The final dataset stored in SQLite format  
- new_column_creation.sql - SQL script to create a new column with the average rating for each movie  
- queries.sql - A set of SQL queries used in the analysis


How to Reproduce the Project:

1. Adjust the TMDB Parameter  
    In the Jupyter Notebook, under paragraph 1.1 (API Requests), modify the vote_count.gte parameter in the third code cell of the TMDB section. Set it to a higher value (30 should be enough until at least July 2025). This is necessary due to OMDB's request limit (1000 requests per day) and because, over time, more movies accumulate votes and qualify for the request.

2. Run the Notebook Skipping Comments Acquisition  
   Execute the Jupyter Notebook, skipping the Reddit section in paragraph 1.1 (API Requests), as it takes over two hours to complete. The rest of the notebook should take approximately five minutes to run.

3. Query the Database  
   Open the data_management.db file using DB Browser for SQLite. Then open the queries.sql file and run the provided queries.


Notes

- The new_column_creation.sql file can be opened and reviewed, but it does not need to be executed every time.  
- The data_management.db file and the CSV outputs generated by the Notebook represent the final products of our work.
